RectangleStuffs
===============

Just my codes for a coding problem having to do with rectangles n stuffs

Requirements for the problem:

1. Intersection: You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more
intersecting lines and produce a result identifying the points of intersection.

2. Containment: You must be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within
another rectangle.

3. Adjacency: Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is
defined as the sharing of a side. Side sharing may be proper or sub-line, where a sub-line share
is one where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points wholly contained on
some other side of rectangle B.
